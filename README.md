The rust audio ecosystem is rather fragmented. The authors of multiple large rust
audio engines are to come together try and unify the audio crate ecosystem.

We are at an early beginning. The text on this repo is a work in progress, it should be seen as a *rough* draft. It will change over time with more input.

## State
We are currently working on:
- defining the goals of the effort [discussion here]()
- planning a demo which will compare audio engines [discussion here]()
